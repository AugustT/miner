[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbroman/miner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbroman/miner>)

Following [py3minepi](https://github.com/py3minepi/py3minepi), an R package that allows
connection to the
[Minecraft API](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html)
using [RaspberryJuice](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/raspberryjuice)
and either [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) or
[Minecraft:Pi](https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/).

The mineR package provides a a few simple functions to manipulate the Minecraft world from R. See
the [vignette](vignettes/mineR.Rmd) for details on setting up a Minecraft server and using
this package.

The 
intent of this package is to encourage new R users to learn R by writing scripts to do fun things
in Minecraft. (See the [extra_vignettes](extra_vignettes) folder for details.) 
For example, with these functions you could:

Take an image of a photograph and render it as a wall of blocks:

Generate a random maze in R, and create it in the world for players to explore:

Give the player the powers of Elsa: [freeze water as you run over it](https://youtu.be/6gcRyuj0smg)
or create towers of ice with a gesture:
